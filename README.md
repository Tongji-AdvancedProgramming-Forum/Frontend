# 维护说明

笔者对前端了解不多，如有糟糕的地方请大家帮忙重构。

<!-- ## CSS

项目使用了两个组件库：Carbon（负责提供统一的设计样式）和 React Suite（负责实现一些 Carbon 没有的小组件）。使用两个组件库本身是非常糟糕的一件事情，如有可能欢迎大家重构代码，把 React Suite 中使用到的组件重新自己实现一遍。

为了防止可能的 CSS 污染，项目中**请不要 import 整个 rsuite 的 css 文件**，而是按需引入。

我目前还没有找到如何无损在 create-react-app 中使用 less-loader 的方法。由于对 react 还不算熟悉，不打算考虑将 create-react-app 进行 eject 操作以引入 less-loader。因此，请大家在`src/styles/rsuite.less`中导入所用到组件的 less 样式表，并在导入后手动运行`lessc rsuite.less > rsuite.css`。

如果有更优雅的解决方法，敬请不吝赐教。 -->

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
